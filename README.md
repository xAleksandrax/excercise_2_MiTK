# File Hashing Application README

# Overview:
This Python script provides a graphical interface for hashing files and measuring hashing time for different message sizes using various hashing algorithms. The application is built using the tkinter library for the GUI and hashlib for hashing functionalities.

# Features:
Hash File: Allows users to select a file from their system and hash it using the selected hashing algorithm.
Choose Hashing Algorithm: Provides a dropdown menu to select the desired hashing algorithm from the available options.
Browse File: Opens a dialog window for users to select the file they want to hash.
Display Hashing Results: Displays the hash value of the file along with the selected algorithm and the time taken for hashing.
Hash Message: Enables users to hash text messages using the selected hashing algorithm.
Show Hashing Time Plot: Generates a plot showing the hashing time against different message sizes, helping users visualize the performance of the selected hashing algorithm.

# How to Run the Script:
Prerequisites:

Python 3 installed on your system.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip.

# Execution:
Download the script (exercise_2.py) to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python exercise_2.py

# Using the Application:
Upon running the script, a GUI window will open.
Choose the desired hashing algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Browse" button to select a file for hashing.
After selecting the file, click on the "Hash File" button to hash the file and display the result.
Additionally, you can click on the "Show Hashing Time Plot" button to visualize the hashing time against different message sizes.

# Note:
This script provides a convenient way to hash files and measure hashing performance. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the files you want to hash.
